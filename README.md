## Inspiration
Energy Crisis and therefore reducing power consumption
## What it does
Monitoring power usage and self sufficient energy generation
## How we built it
Front end mobile application using SWIFT with python backend
## Challenges we ran into
Migrating design drafts into hard code; API calculation of areas from real life coordinates
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Backend functions with real world estimations for calculating; App and Presentation Design
## What we learned
API usage in real cases; Front end application design for mobile devices; Red Bull doesn't replace water
## What's next for Smart Sustainabilty Monitoring
Adding more features like:
- Advanced settings for calculations to get more accurate estimations
- Adding battery support to save power if there is an overload
